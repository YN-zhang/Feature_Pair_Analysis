##Introduction

Genome architecture mapping (GAM) is a new 3D genome profiling technique that doesn't depend on DNA ligation [cite GAM]. We used the GAM chromatin interaction data for mouse embryonic stem cells to study the 3D genome structures in the Histone Locus Body (HLB), which is a nuclear body specialized in the transcription of histone genes [cite HLB]. Using public datasets (i.e. features), we explored the chromatin interactions and epigenomic features of the major histone gene cluster (hist1) on chr13. GAM characterized chromatin interactions at 30kb resolution. We produced a table that characterizes each 30kb window within the hist1 region. This document describes the features contained in the table.
